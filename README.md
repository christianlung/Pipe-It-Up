## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to simulate the pipe operator used in shells. Using file descriptors and knowledge of processes, I was able to construct the program that takes any arbitrary number of commands and pipe the result between output to input. The project contains proper order of execution as well as error handling and deallocation of resources.

## Pipe Up

Write low level code to emulate the pipe operator in shells

## Building

Explain briefly how to build your program
Use the command "make"
## Running

Show an example run of your program, using at least two additional arguments, and what to expect
./pipe ls cat wc
Should print 5  5   51

## Cleaning up

Explain briefly how to clean up all binary files
Use the command "make clean"
